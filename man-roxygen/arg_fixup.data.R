#' @param fixup.data [\code{character(1)}]\cr
#'   Should some basic cleaning up of data be performed?
#'   Currently this means removing empty factor levels for the columns.
#'   Possible choices are:
#'   \dQuote{no} = Don't do it.
#'   \dQuote{warn} = Do it but warn about it.
#'   \dQuote{quiet} = Do it but keep silent.
#'   Default is \dQuote{warn}.
